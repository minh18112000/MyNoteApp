# MyNoteApp
This is my first app. 
In this app, I use:
- Binding
- Room Database and coroutines
- Safe Args
- Navigation
- Architecture components (MVVM)
- SearchView
- RecyclerView
- Repository

Features I built:
- Create and save note
- Edit and delete note
- Search note by note title or note body
- Share note 
- Sort note by title A-Z or Z-A
- Sort note by created date (newest first or oldest first)
- Sort note by updated date (newest first or oldest first)
